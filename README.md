## Project Description

This project aims to leverage machine learning to offer personalized career guidance to students, especially those in rural areas who lack access to traditional counseling services. By analyzing data points such as academic performance, skills, and interests, the ML model provides tailored career recommendations.

## Motivation

### Children's Potential Power
Every child in India is a valuable asset with the potential to significantly contribute to the country's growth across various sectors.

### Awareness of Study Fields
Students in rural areas often lack awareness of emerging study fields and career opportunities, making it challenging for them to align their skills and interests with industry demands.

### Importance of Proper Guidance
Proper counseling is crucial in helping students determine the most suitable career paths, which is essential for national development.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing ensures the dataset is accurate and consistent. The dataset contains 9179 samples and 28 columns. The data source link is: [CareerPrediction.csv](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5z68cvxssn/1)
## Machine Learning Methods Used
## Model Training
- **Random Forest**: Train accuracy - 97%, Test accuracy - 89% 

## Conclusion
The revised model was trained on a dataset with reduced columns to improve its effectiveness for predicting suitable career paths for students, particularly in rural areas. The models were evaluated based on their training and test accuracies, with the Random Forest model performing the best in the revised dataset.

## Web Application
We have built an web application of this project using the best performing model. This Web application predict students career by asking some skill rating.
